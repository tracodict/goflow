This is a placeholder for implementing your hierarchical navigation. Here's a summary of what was attempted:

**Goal:** Redesign vertical navigation with:
- Top-level icons (Workspace, Builder, Data, Schema, MCP, Chat, Workflow)
- Nested second-level tabs (e.g., Builder contains Components and Structure)
- Styling cues: indentation, shadows, borders for clarity

**Challenges encountered:**
1. Complex existing file structure made inline edits error-prone
2. Duplicate code blocks created parse errors
3. Type system complexity with existing tab infrastructure

**Recommended simpler approach:**
Instead of restructuring the entire panel, you can:
1. Add a `group` metadata field to each existing tab
2. Render group headers inline within the tab list
3. Apply indented styling to child tabs
4. Keep the existing single-column rail and simply add grouping visuals

This avoids major refactoring while achieving the visual hierarchy you wanted. I can implement this lighter approach if you'd like to continue.
