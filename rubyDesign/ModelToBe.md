For GoLang, there are several alternative data stores to MySQL binlog or Zeebe file store that can support high-volume operations for the Model component without relying on a traditional database. These alternatives can append delta changes to workflow elements and reconstruct the final status based on the history of these changes. Here are some options:

1. Event Sourcing with Append-Only Log:
   - Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform
   - NATS Streaming: A data streaming system

2. Time-Series Database:
   - InfluxDB: An open-source time series database
   - TimescaleDB: A time-series database built on PostgreSQL

3. Distributed Key-Value Store:
   - etcd: A distributed, reliable key-value store
   - Redis: An in-memory data structure store

4. Custom Append-Only File System:
   - Implement using Go's standard library with memory-mapped files

5. LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database):
   - A high-performance embedded key-value store with Go bindings

Implementation Approach:

1. Event Storage: Store changes as events with timestamp, event type, entity ID, and delta change data.
2. State Reconstruction: Implement a service to reconstruct current state by replaying events.
3. Query Layer: Develop an efficient query layer for retrieving current states and historical data.
4. Consistency and Concurrency: Use optimistic concurrency control and implement a versioning system.
5. Scalability: Design for horizontal scalability.

Example Go code structure:

```go
package model

import (
    "time"
    // Import chosen data store library
)

type Event struct {
    Timestamp   time.Time
    Type        string
    EntityID    string
    DeltaChange interface{}
}

type EventStore interface {
    AppendEvent(event Event) error
    GetEvents(entityID string, fromTimestamp time.Time) ([]Event, error)
}

type StateReconstructor interface {
    ReconstructState(entityID string) (interface{}, error)
}

type Model struct {
    eventStore EventStore
    reconstructor StateReconstructor
}

func (m *Model) ApplyChange(entityID string, changeType string, change interface{}) error {
    event := Event{
        Timestamp:   time.Now(),
        Type:        changeType,
        EntityID:    entityID,
        DeltaChange: change,
    }
    return m.eventStore.AppendEvent(event)
}

func (m *Model) GetCurrentState(entityID string) (interface{}, error) {
    return m.reconstructor.ReconstructState(entityID)
}
```

This approach allows for high-volume operations by focusing on appending changes rather than updating a traditional database, providing both performance and flexibility for the workflow engine.
