## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Storage Architecture
- **Decision**: Implemented abstract storage interface with go-memdb as primary implementation
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility for future MongoDB integration while ensuring immediate functionality
- **Impact**: Zero external dependencies for basic operation, easy testing and development

### 2. Package Naming
- **Decision**: Renamed `case` package to `casemanager` to avoid Go keyword conflict
- **Rationale**: Go reserves `case` as a keyword, causing compilation errors
- **Impact**: Clean compilation with descriptive package naming

### 3. Concurrency Model
- **Decision**: Used goroutines with mutex synchronization for case execution
- **Rationale**: Leverages Go's strength in concurrent programming
- **Impact**: Efficient parallel processing of multiple workflow instances

### 4. API Design
- **Decision**: RESTful API with JSON payloads and proper HTTP status codes
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for web service integration
- **Impact**: Easy integration with frontend applications and external systems

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual package testing for core functionality
- Mock implementations for isolated testing
- Coverage of edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflow testing (`integration_test.go`)
- API endpoint testing with real HTTP requests
- Concurrent case creation testing
- Workflow validation testing

### API Testing
- Comprehensive API test script (`test_api.sh`)
- Manual testing of all endpoints
- Error condition testing

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage
- In-memory storage provides fast access with minimal overhead
- go-memdb provides ACID transactions with snapshot isolation
- Efficient token management with minimal memory footprint

### Concurrency
- Multiple workflow instances execute concurrently
- Thread-safe operations with proper synchronization
- Automatic transition firing with configurable intervals

### Scalability
- Modular architecture supports horizontal scaling
- Abstract storage interface enables database scaling
- Stateless API design supports load balancing

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Password hashing using SHA-256
- JWT token-based authentication (basic implementation)
- Role-based access control with permission checking

### API Security
- CORS configuration for controlled access
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## Deployment Considerations

### Configuration
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Automatic storage fallback mechanism
- Configurable server port and storage type

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies
- Self-contained binary deployment
- No external services required for basic operation
