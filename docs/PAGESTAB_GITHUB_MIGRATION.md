# PagesTab GitHub Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated PagesTab from localStorage-based storage to GitHub repository storage with immediate commit workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. FileMenu Enhancements (`components/builder/FileMenu.tsx`)

**Added:**
- "New Folder" menu item with `FolderPlus` icon
- Folder creation logic in the action handler
- Support for creating folders in the Pages directory

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Added folder handling to the action map
'new-folder': 'Pages',

// Added folder creation logic
if (isFolder) {
  await createFile('Pages', name, true) // true = isFolder
}
```

### 2. Workspace Store Extensions (`stores/workspace-store.ts`)

**Added Methods:**
- `deleteFile(path: string)` - Deletes a file from GitHub and local state
- `renameFile(oldPath: string, newPath: string)` - Renames/moves files by copy+delete
- `createFile` now accepts optional `isFolder` parameter

**Folder Creation:**
- Folders created by adding `.gitkeep` file: `Pages/FolderName/.gitkeep`
- This follows Git convention where empty folders don't exist

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Rename uses copy+delete pattern
1. Fetch original file content and SHA
2. Create new file with same content at new path
3. Delete original file using its SHA
4. Update local state and reload tree
```

### 3. File API Endpoint (`app/api/github/workspace/file/route.ts`)

**Added:**
- `DELETE` method for file deletion
- Uses GitHub's `deleteFile` API
- Requires file SHA for deletion (prevents concurrent modification issues)

**Signature:**
```typescript
DELETE /api/github/workspace/file
Body: { owner, repo, branch, path, sha }
Returns: { success: true }
```

### 4. PagesTab Complete Rewrite (`components/builder/tabs/PagesTab.tsx`)

**Migration Strategy:**
- Original localStorage version backed up as `PagesTab-localStorage.tsx.bak`
- New GitHub-based version is now the active `PagesTab.tsx`

**Key Architectural Changes:**

#### Data Source
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `usePagesStore()` (localStorage) | `useWorkspace()` (GitHub API) |
| Hierarchical PageItem tree | File tree from GitHub repository |
| Parent-child relationship via `parentId` | File paths like `Pages/Folder/Page.page` |

#### File Tree Building
```typescript
// Filters workspace tree for Pages folder only
const pagesFolder = tree.find(node => 
  node.name === 'Pages' && node.type === 'directory'
)

// Converts file paths to FileExplorer items
// Pages/About.page → { id: 'Pages/About.page', name: 'About', type: 'file' }
// Pages/Admin/ → { id: 'Pages/Admin', name: 'Admin', type: 'folder' }
```

#### Workspace Guard
- Shows "No workspace open" message if workspace not loaded
- Provides button to trigger File → Open Workspace dialog
- All operations disabled until workspace is open

#### Operations Implementation

**Delete (Immediate Commit):**
```typescript
// Calls workspace store method which:
1. Fetches file to get SHA
2. Calls DELETE /api/github/workspace/file
3. Commits deletion to temp branch
4. Reloads file tree
```

**Rename (Immediate Commit):**
```typescript
// Renames by moving file:
1. Builds new path from new name
2. Calls renameFile(oldPath, newPath)
3. Creates commit in temp branch
4. Updates UI via tree reload
```

**Move (Immediate Commit):**
```typescript
// Uses same renameFile method:
1. Constructs new path with new parent folder
2. Calls renameFile to move file
3. Commits move to temp branch
```

**File Creation:**
- Handled by File → New Page menu
- Prompts for name, creates `Pages/Name.page` with template
- Auto-commits to temp branch

**Folder Creation:**
- Handled by File → New Folder menu
- Creates `Pages/FolderName/.gitkeep`
- Auto-commits to temp branch

#### Removed Features
- Add Folder/Add Page buttons in FileExplorer (disabled via `showActions={false}`)
- All add dialogs removed (now handled by File menu)
- Direct page storage in localStorage

#### Retained Features
- Unsaved changes detection dialog
- File/folder rename via inline edit
- Drag-and-drop file moving
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Navigation to builder mode on page select

### 5. Immediate Commit Workflow

**How It Works:**

Every file operation (create, update, delete, rename, move) creates an immediate commit in the temporary branch:

1. **User performs action** (e.g., renames a file)
2. **API endpoint executes** with commit message (e.g., "Update Pages/NewName.page")
3. **GitHub creates commit** in temp branch automatically
4. **File tree reloads** to reflect changes
5. **User sees updated UI** immediately

**Commit Messages:**
- Create: `"Create Pages/About.page"`
- Update: `"Update Pages/About.page"`
- Delete: `"Delete Pages/About.page"`
- Rename (internally): `"Create Pages/NewName.page"` + `"Delete Pages/OldName.page"`

**Final Save:**
When user clicks File → Save Workspace:
1. All commits in temp branch are squashed
2. User provides a single commit message
3. Squashed commit is merged to main branch
4. Temp branch is deleted

This gives best of both worlds:
- ✅ Immediate commits for safety (no lost work)
- ✅ Clean history on main branch (single squashed commit)
- ✅ Reviewable changes before final merge

## File Changes Summary

**Modified:**
- `components/builder/FileMenu.tsx` - Added "New Folder" menu item
- `components/builder/tabs/PagesTab.tsx` - Complete rewrite for GitHub storage
- `stores/workspace-store.ts` - Added deleteFile, renameFile methods
- `app/api/github/workspace/file/route.ts` - Added DELETE endpoint

**Backed Up:**
- `components/builder/tabs/PagesTab-localStorage.tsx.bak` - Original version

**Total Lines Changed:** ~450 lines added/modified

## Testing Checklist

### File Menu Operations
- [ ] File → New Page creates page in GitHub
- [ ] File → New Folder creates folder with .gitkeep
- [ ] File → Save Workspace squashes and merges commits

### PagesTab Operations
- [ ] Opening workspace loads Pages tree correctly
- [ ] Selecting page navigates to builder mode
- [ ] Renaming page updates GitHub and UI
- [ ] Deleting page removes from GitHub
- [ ] Moving page to folder works via drag-drop
- [ ] Unsaved changes dialog appears when switching pages

### GitHub Integration
- [ ] Each operation creates a commit in temp branch
- [ ] Commits have descriptive messages
- [ ] File tree refreshes after each operation
- [ ] Save Workspace creates single squashed commit on main

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No workspace open shows guard message
- [ ] Empty Pages folder shows empty tree
- [ ] Network errors show toast notifications
- [ ] Concurrent edits handled via SHA validation

## Migration Notes

**For Users:**
- Pages previously in localStorage will NOT be migrated automatically
- Users need to manually recreate pages in a GitHub repository
- Or export localStorage data and import into GitHub repo

**For Developers:**
- Original PagesTab backed up as `.bak` file
- Can restore localStorage version if needed
- Both versions can coexist during transition period

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real GitHub Repository**
   - Create test repo with OAuth app configured
   - Test full workflow: open → create → edit → delete → save
   - Verify commits appear correctly in GitHub

2. **Add Migration Tool (Optional)**
   - Export localStorage pages to JSON
   - Import JSON into GitHub repository
   - Preserve folder structure and page content

3. **Enhance File Menu**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N for new page)
   - Add recent workspaces list
   - Add workspace switching without closing

4. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Better GitHub API error messages
   - Retry logic for network failures
   - Offline detection and queueing

## Known Limitations

1. **No Empty Folders:** GitHub doesn't support empty folders, so folders only exist if they contain files (.gitkeep workaround used)

2. **Rename = Copy+Delete:** File renames create two commits (create + delete) instead of a true rename/move operation

3. **No Conflict Resolution:** If two users edit the same file simultaneously, last writer wins (SHA validation prevents data corruption but doesn't merge changes)

4. **File Tree Reload:** Every operation reloads the entire tree instead of incremental updates (acceptable for small repos, may need optimization for large projects)
