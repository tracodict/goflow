# GitHub Workspace Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete GitHub workspace integration for GoFlow, enabling version-controlled storage of all GoFlow artifacts (pages, datasources, queries, workflows, schemas, and MCP tools) in GitHub repositories.

## Implementation Date
October 23, 2025

## Completed Features

### 1. Authentication System ✅
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Complete GitHub OAuth integration

## Repository Folder Structure

When a workspace is opened, the following structure is created:

```
<repository-root>/
├── Pages/              # Page definitions (.page)
├── DataSources/        # Data source configs (.ds)
├── Queries/            # Query definitions (.qry)
├── Workflows/          # Petri net workflows (.cpn)
├── Schemas/            # Color schemas (.color)
└── MCPTools/           # MCP tool configs (.mcp)
```

## Dependencies Installed

- `@octokit/rest@22.0.0` - GitHub REST API client
- `iron-session@8.0.4` - Secure session management

## Security Features

1. **OAuth 2.0**: Standard GitHub authentication flow
2. **State Token Verification**: CSRF protection in OAuth flow
3. **Encrypted Sessions**: Iron-session with 32+ character secret
4. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Prevent XSS attacks
5. **Secure Flag**: HTTPS-only in production
6. **SameSite Policy**: CSRF protection
7. **Minimal Scopes**: Only `repo` and `user:email` requested

## Workflow

1. **Open Workspace**
   - User clicks "File → Open Workspace"
   - Authenticates with GitHub (if not already)
   - Enters repository URL
   - System creates temp branch from main
   - Initializes folder structure if needed
   - Loads file tree

2. **Edit Files**
   - User clicks file in explorer
   - File content loaded from GitHub
   - Appropriate editor opened via event dispatcher
   - Changes tracked with dirty state

3. **Save Files**
   - Individual file saves commit to temp branch
   - Each save creates a commit with auto-generated message

4. **Save Workspace**
   - User clicks "File → Save Workspace"
   - Enters commit message
   - All temp branch commits squashed
   - Merged to main branch as single commit
   - Temp branch deleted

## Integration Points

The workspace system integrates with GoFlow through custom events:

- `goflow-open-file`: Opens file in appropriate editor
- `goflow-load-page`: Loads page in page builder
- `goflow-switch-tab`: Switches to specific tab/editor
- `goflow-open-query`: Opens query editor
- `goflow-open-workflow`: Opens workflow editor
- `goflow-open-schema`: Opens schema editor
- `goflow-open-mcp-tool`: Opens MCP tool editor
- `goflow-save-file`: Triggers active editor to save

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 2 (Recommended)
- [ ] Real-time collaboration support
- [ ] Branch management (work on feature branches)
- [ ] Visual merge conflict resolver
- [ ] File history viewer
- [ ] Diff view before committing

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] GitLab/Bitbucket support
- [ ] Offline mode with sync
- [ ] Import/export functionality
- [ ] Repository templates
- [ ] Multi-workspace support

## Testing Checklist

Before using in production:

- [ ] Set up GitHub OAuth App
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test workspace open/close
- [ ] Test file creation in all folders
- [ ] Test file editing and saving
- [ ] Test workspace save (commit squashing)
- [ ] Test permission handling (private repos)
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network issues, auth failures)
- [ ] Test with different repository sizes
- [ ] Verify session expiration handling
- [ ] Check security headers in production

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Base Branch**: Currently only supports `main` as base branch
2. **No Conflict Resolution**: Manual resolution required if conflicts occur
3. **No File History UI**: Must use GitHub directly to view history
4. **No Diff Preview**: Can't see changes before committing workspace
5. **Linear Workflow**: No branch management beyond temp branches
6. **Organization Repos**: May require additional OAuth approval for org repos

## Performance Considerations

- File tree loading is recursive and may be slow for large repositories
- Each file open makes a separate API call to GitHub
- No caching implemented (future enhancement)
- Rate limiting should be considered for heavy usage

## Compliance Notes

- OAuth scopes are minimal (`repo`, `user:email`)
- Session data is encrypted at rest
- No user data stored on server beyond session
- GDPR compliant (user controls data in their GitHub repo)
- Can be easily extended for audit logging
