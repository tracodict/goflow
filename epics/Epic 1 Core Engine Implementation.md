# Epic 1: Core Engine Implementation

## Overview
This epic focuses on implementing the core engine of the Petri Net-Based Workflow Engine. It includes setting up the in-memory database fallback, implementing the Petri net core logic, developing state management, and implementing concurrency control.

## User Stories

### User Story 1.0: Implement In-Memory Database Fallback
**Description:** Set up go-memdb as a fallback option when MongoDB is not configured, ensuring the system can operate without an external database.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up go-memdb schema for all entities
2. Implement abstract data store interface
3. Create go-memdb implementation of the data store interface
4. Implement automatic fallback to go-memdb when MongoDB is not configured

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- go-memdb schema is correctly set up for all required entities
- Abstract data store interface is implemented and can be used with different storage backends
- go-memdb implementation of the data store interface is complete and functional
- System automatically falls back to go-memdb when MongoDB is not configured

**Test Cases:**
- Unit test for go-memdb schema creation
- Integration test for abstract data store interface
- System test for automatic fallback to go-memdb

### User Story 1.1: Implement Petri Net Core Logic
**Description:** Develop the core Petri net structures and logic, including places, transitions, arcs, and token movement.

**Tasks:**
1. Develop basic Petri net structures (places, transitions, arcs)
2. Implement token movement logic
3. Create transition firing mechanism

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Basic Petri net structures are implemented and can be instantiated
- Token movement logic correctly handles token creation, movement, and consumption
- Transition firing mechanism correctly evaluates and executes enabled transitions

**Test Cases:**
- Unit test for creating a simple Petri net
- Unit test for token movement
- Integration test for transition firing

### User Story 1.2: Develop State Management
**Description:** Implement state representation, transition logic, and persistence for Petri nets.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement state representation for Petri nets
2. Create state transition logic
3. Develop state persistence mechanism

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Petri net states are correctly represented and can be manipulated
- State transition logic accurately reflects the Petri net execution semantics
- States can be persisted and retrieved from the chosen storage backend

**Test Cases:**
- Unit test for state representation
- Integration test for state transitions
- Integration test for state persistence

### User Story 1.3: Implement Concurrency Control
**Description:** Develop mechanisms for parallel execution, synchronization, and deadlock detection/resolution in the Petri net engine.

**Tasks:**
1. Develop parallel execution mechanism using goroutines
2. Implement synchronization primitives
3. Create deadlock detection and resolution

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Petri net execution can be performed in parallel using goroutines
- Synchronization primitives ensure thread-safe operations on shared resources
- Deadlock detection mechanism identifies potential deadlocks, and resolution strategies are in place

**Test Cases:**
- Unit test for parallel execution
- Integration test for synchronization
- Stress test for deadlock detection and resolution

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure thread-safety in all core engine components
- Optimize for performance, especially in token movement and transition firing
- Design for extensibility to allow future enhancements of the Petri net model
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the core engine

## Dependencies
- Go 1.16+
- go-memdb library
- MongoDB driver (for non-fallback scenarios)

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Performance bottlenecks in parallel execution
  Mitigation: Conduct thorough performance testing and optimize critical paths
- Risk: Complexity in deadlock detection and resolution
  Mitigation: Start with a simple detection algorithm and iteratively improve based on real-world scenarios
- Risk: Data consistency issues in concurrent operations
  Mitigation: Implement robust transaction management and use appropriate locking mechanisms

## Estimation
- User Story 1.0: 3 story points
- User Story 1.1: 5 story points
- User Story 1.2: 4 story points
- User Story 1.3: 6 story points

Total: 18 story points

# Go-Petri-Flow

Go-Petri-Flow is a Petri Net-Based Workflow Engine implemented in Go. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for modeling and executing complex business processes using the mathematical foundations of Petri nets.

## Features

- Petri net-based workflow modeling and execution
- Support for both MongoDB and in-memory (go-memdb) storage backends
- Concurrent execution of workflow instances
- Dynamic workflow definitions with versioning
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for users and tasks
- RESTful API for integration with other systems
- Customizable form management for user tasks
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- MongoDB (optional, for persistent storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-petri-flow.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd go-petri-flow
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```
   go build ./...
   ```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. Edit `config.yaml` to set your desired configuration options, including the choice of storage backend (MongoDB or go-memdb).

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

2. The server will start on the configured port (default: 8080).

## Usage

Refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for detailed information on how to use the Go-Petri-Flow API to create, manage, and execute workflows.
