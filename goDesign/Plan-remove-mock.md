no, let me rephrase the requirements.
1. The server povide core APIs summarised at #file:CORE_APIs.md 
  a. load a new workflow or update an existing workflow identified by `id` conforming to scehma at #file:go-petri-flow.json  to the server
  b. list all workflows loaded to server
  c. List all transitions of a workflow identified by its `id` 
  d. when a transition is in `enabled` status, the API to fire the transition
  e. get current marking, which can be used to trace the tokens at each transition, e.g., before fire a transition and after a transition
  f. simulate to move the network one step further, i.e., fire a transition enabled selected by the petri net server
2. revamp the implementation so that the following operations will trigger API calls to server:
  a. CRUD operations of a whole workflow, 
  b. simulate execution step by step
  c. monitor transition status
  d. monitor marking

3. edit the workflow diagrams #file:flow-workspace.tsx will all handled at client side, except for above interaction with server:
  a. CRUD operations of places/transitions/arcs
  b. expand/collapse workflow at `Explorer`
  c. edit of node properties
  d. edit colorSets of a workflow, which is not existing in current ocde, add it
3. to do above, revamp and rename #file:mock-workflow-store.ts so that its purpose is to more to define types and handle conversion between xyflow's schema data and go-petric-flow scehma data
4. also revamp and rename #file:petri-sim.ts as the simulation will stay at server side
5. optimise and simplify and unify design at #file:flow-workspace.tsx to manage display update based on marking's status and changes


Based on first round suggestion from gpt 5:

1. Extract pure conversion utilities from mock-workflow-store into a new module (graph <-> server schema) and then remove remaining mock data/functions.
2. Implement workflow CRUD (create/update/delete) via API in petriClient.ts and wire to Explorer (server mode).
3. Remove remaining event listeners and mock-store dependencies entirely.
4. Add colorSets editing & persistence.
5. Add polling or websocket-based marking refresh (current monitor updates only on actions).
6. Delete petri-sim.ts once all imports migrated to petri-types.ts.

2nd round:

1. Remove mock store entirely: replace remaining imports (updateWorkflowFromGraph, syncListsIntoGraph) with conversion module usage and delete mock-workflow-store.ts.
2. Wire Explorer in server mode: use CRUD endpoints for create/delete and a save (load) button for persistence; enable rename via server (needs endpoint or re-save).
3. Add colorSets editing UI (e.g., simple list editor in System Settings or SidePanel) calling updateColorSets.
4. Implement polling (e.g., interval in monitor effect) for marking + transitions (until websockets available).
5. Delete petri-sim.ts after confirming no residual imports.
6. Replace save path in flow-workspace.tsx to use graphToServer + saveWorkflow.

3rd round:

1. Implement polling (interval while Monitor tab active) to refresh marking & transitions.
2. remove createWorkflow, adding a workflow will use saveWorkflow(), when the `id` is not existing, it's to create new one at server (so called load to server)
3. deleteWorkflowApi and updateColorSets is not yet implemented at server, hold on the client change
4. Add optimistic state updates or refetch list after CRUD actions (if not already handled in FlowWorkspace). be noted the CRUD is at whole workflow level, server doesn't support CRUD at finer granularity yet.
5. Remove any stale console.logs (e.g., serverMarking) after debugging.

4th round:

1. "DELETE /api/cpn/delete": "Delete a CPN by ID", is implemented at server. Update UI so that when mouse move over a row of workflow at `Explorer`, show delete button at right side. when delete button is clicked, call server delete API. Up on the delete API succeed, remove the workflow from client UI.
2. fix error when save a diagram, by POST https://goflow.lizhao.net//api/cpn/load
{
    "error": "invalid_cpn",
    "message": "Failed to parse CPN: failed to parse arcs: unknown arc direction '' for arc 'e-i2axo'"
}

5th round:

Revamp `Explorer` expand and collapse logic:
1. Don't trigger collapse or expand a node at `Explorer` when the name or icons are clicked.
2. add small icons like VS Code's style before folder to indicate expand or collapse status. when the icon indicate collapsed status, click it will expand, vice versa. 
3. expand a workflow would list its `colorSets`, `places`, `transitions` and `arcs`
4. above four group can be expanded to list all items in each group
5. CRUD operations are allowed at the tree structure in `Explorer`

Since the sub items inside each diagram is client side only, these revamped logic shouldn't trigger server call. 

1. Expand a workflow tree node didn't show up the colorsets/place/transition/arcs. fix it.
2. show delete and open buttons only when mouse move over that tree node's row 

All expanded colorSets/places/transitions/arcs show empty group. for reference, before revamp to remove mockup, updateWorkflowFromGraph was used to sync up the xyflow data structure and data structure conforming with #file:go-petri-flow.json , which can be used to render the tree nodes expanded. But don't use the #file:mock-workflow-store.ts , revamp if it's required

6th round:
1. the new `add` button after colorSets/place/transition/arc group should show only when mouse move out the tree row
2. the `delete` button after leave node of colorSets/place/transition/arc should show only when mouse move over the row
3. remove `add` button after arc group
4. sync up select at `Explorer` and xyflow diagram, i.e., if a node is selected at Explorer, it should be selected at xyflow diagram node too, vice versa
5. Arc creation UI to pick endpoints instead of first place/transition.
6. Inline guard/type editing from the tree.

7th round:

Revamp `Monitor` tab now.
1. Call fetchMarking and fetchTransitionsStatus to update data for `Monitor` tab in the following events:
  a. open `Monitor`
  b. up on change of workflow opened
  c. after firing an enabled transition, with 1s delay so that server can finish the transition 
  d. after simulation step forward or reset
